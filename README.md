Patched SemanticScuttle (social bookmarking tool).
================================================

### New :

* Better import for XML bookmark file.
* Support for adding multiple bookmarks at once with my modified Firefox's Scuttle plugin.
* Block everything if global private mode enabled and user not logged on.
* Shoulder surfing protection.
* Batch tagging.
* Search will now look in bookmarks addresses too.
